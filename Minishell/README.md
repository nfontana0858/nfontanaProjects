1.Developed a fully functional Unix-style shell in C with support for 5 built-in commands (cd, pwd, exit, lf, lp) and external program execution via fork() & execvp(), handling up to 10 command-line arguments.
2.Implemented robust signal handling, including a custom SIGINT interrupt handler, preventing shell termination on Ctrl+C and ensuring seamless continuous operation.
3.Added comprehensive directory navigation features with support for absolute/relative paths, home directory expansion, and smooth command execution flow.
