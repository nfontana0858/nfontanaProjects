1.Designed and implemented a custom 22-bit CPU in Logisim-evolution with a fully defined instruction set architecture, enabling accurate simulation of real processor behavior.

2.Built core processor components including RAM for memory storage, an ALU supporting arithmetic operations, and four general-purpose registers with load/store capabilities for memory interaction.

3.Developed a Python-based assembler that translates ARM-style assembly instructions into machine code using bitwise operations and custom encoding logic.
